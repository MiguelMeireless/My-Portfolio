        <h3>Projects</h3>
        <li>Industry Based Project (Unilever) (2023/24) (70%)</p>
            <p> In collaboration with Unilever, a group project was completed during the final year of a Master's 
                program, achieving first-class honors. The project involved developing an advanced machine 
                vision system to detect and classify various laboratory spills. This system was integrated with a 
                collaborative robot (cobot) arm, which was programmed to autonomously clean spills using 
                custom-designed tools for different viscosities and sizes. Additionally, software was created to 
                alert Unilever about spill types and sizes, ensuring compliance with laboratory regulations and 
                maintaining a safe working environment. </p>
        <li>Development of heating solution for hypothermia in pre hospital care(2024) (76%) </p>
            <p>This report details the development of a tune able heating solution tailored to address 
                    hypothermic conditions in mountainous environments. Extensive literature review 
                    encompassing medical regulations, treatment methodologies, and mountain-specific research 
                    informed the project's direction. The selected solution comprises a sleeping bag heater 
                    configuration integrated with a harness for user monitoring. Key findings include a mummy
                    shaped sleeping bag design with double-sided zipper access, heater pads powered by a bottom
                    nested supply, and an Arduino LCD screen for vital sign monitoring. Thermal CFD analysis 
                    optimized heater layout for even heat distribution. The harness incorporates temperature and 
                    heart rate sensors using neoprene for breathability and waterproofing. The final integrated 
                    product addresses hypothermia prevention with gradual warming and temperature monitoring, 
                    meeting 78% of design requirements. Future work aims to explore material options and 
                    manufacturing processes for consumer affordability. </p>
        <li>Industry Based Project (Bosch) (2021/22) (72%) </p>
            <p>This project involved the development of a product concept designed to address global crises. 
                    Our team collaborated with BOSCH, focusing on repurposing a Bosch drill to extract water from 
                    lower ground levels and transport it to higher elevation areas. Within this project, my 
                    contributions were generating the concept, designing and modelling a turbine with optimized 
                    blade shapes, creating an NX assembly, and utilizing 3D printing to prototype the turbine. 
                    </p>
        <li>Non linear study on VEH (2023/24) (84%) </p>
            <p>This 40 page report report investigated the experimental and theoretical modelling of Vibration 
                    Energy Harvesting (VEH) methodologies, with a specific focus on the intentional introduction of 
                    nonlinearities within engineering systems. In this Report, I primarily contributed by doing 
                    numerical analysis(normalized and dimensionless equation), creating phase plots, and doing a 
                    quantitative analysis using the averaging method.</p>
        <li>Design of Acrylic Bracket to support specific load using NX cad and FEA package 
                (Team): (2021)</p>
            <p>  Project consisted in creating a design for a bracket with preexisting supporting points 
                        options. The goal was to withstand a load of exactly 20Kg with minimum deflection and break 
                        with higher loads, 
                        Placed 1st in both assessments out of the entire course. </p>
        <li>Scara Robot, Control Project (2022) </p>
            <p>This report details the development of a tune able heating solution tailored to address 
                                hypothermic conditions in mountainous environments. Extensive literature review

                                informed the project's direction. The selected solution comprises a sleeping bag heater 
                                configuration integrated with a harness for user monitoring. Key findings include a mummy

                                heart rate sensors using neoprene for breathability and waterproofing. The final integrated

        <li>Finite Element Analysis (Tin Can Project) (2023) </p>
            <p>Project consisted of realising ment analysis of a tin can. Geometry was defined using a real life 
                can and different measuring approaches. Material Properties were defined based on research. 
                Project analysed 3 different FEA software and compared against hand calculations.</p>
